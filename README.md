# UNGUARDED // Website still in production (HTML CSS JS)


UNGUARDED Project 
HTML CSS JS
Includes signup form that connects to a mongodb database [Content made by me]
Includes a simple home page
Includes an about page
Includes content page with a custom video player without react 


UNGUARDED Project w/ React
             React Router DOM connection with multiple links to other applications
	Navbar and Footer created 
		Might have to recreate this in bootstrap and simplify later on
	
Created multiple hero sections
	
Sign up form connected to mongo db database
Issues I've run into. Not able to connect a formik form to mongodb, having trouble figuring out what server this will be connected to  and displaying user confirmation. 
             

What still needs to be added
Content page including all videos w/ a custom video player/implementation
Signup/Signin/Register form 

Where have you been running into issues 
Previous content player made wasnâ€™t able to convert into react, would have to make a new one
Navbar became unresponsive when added the Signin form/register form



Using React to build this website out with react-router dom. Created a signin that is connected to mongodb. Working on connecting a formik form to a mongodb server.

Front-End and Back-End development for unguarded.com. UNGUARDED is a sports platform building athletes and brands. 4 years of documenting the top HS athlete's in the country. All the content was filmed, directed, and edited, by your's truly. 21 weeks in my programming journey. 

Few of the steps that I plan to take moving forward
  Add a login page(Backend API is built already and front end) [Nowhere for the user to go at the moment]
  Possibly convert the file into a react project, this way the routing of the page is much more efficent
