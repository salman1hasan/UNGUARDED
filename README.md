Content and images are not available on project due to copyright protection.

Front-End and Back-End development for unguarded.com. UNGUARDED is a sports platform building athletes and brands. 4 years of documenting the top HS athlete's in the country. All the content was filmed, directed, and edited, by your's truly. 20 weeks in my programming journey. 

Few of the steps that I plan to take moving forward
  Add a login page(Backend API is built already and front end) [Nowhere for the user to go at the moment]
  Possibly convert the file into a react project, this way the routing of the page is much more efficent
